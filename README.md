# fDict
A test app made with Flask, similar to urban dictionary.

Requires:
* python
* flask
* mongodb
* flask-login
* flask-pymongo
* flask-bcrypt
* flask-jsglue

Features:
* login system
* search
* typical dictionary features

###If you want to give it a try
You will need to have mongodb, and all the dependaecies installed.
Then use 'python fdict.py' assuming you have Python 3.

**Project status: partially complete, mostly usable, some sloppy code that I should look into making better.**
